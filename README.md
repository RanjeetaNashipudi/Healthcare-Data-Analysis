Healthcare Data Analysis Using SQL and Power BI  Healthcare data analysis involves processing and interpreting large volumes of health-related data to uncover actionable insights. Tools like SQL and Power BI play crucial roles in this process by enabling efficient data handling and visualization.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for managing and analyzing healthcare datasets stored in relational databases.

Data Extraction and Cleaning: SQL helps retrieve data from multiple sources such as EHR (Electronic Health Records), patient surveys, and hospital management systems. It enables data cleaning through filtering, deduplication, and formatting.
SQL can be used to answer specific healthcare queries, such as identifying high-risk patients or trends in disease prevalence.

Interactive Dashboards: Power BI creates dynamic dashboards that present data like patient demographics, disease patterns, and resource utilization in a visually appealing format.

By combining SQL's robust data handling capabilities with Power BI's visualization and analysis tools, healthcare organizations can transform raw data into meaningful insights, driving better decision-making and patient outcomes.
